## Forkify Recipe App üçï

Forkify App is an functional application made with vanilla JavaScript. It interacts with the Forkify API to fetch and display recipes.    
The user can search for a specific recipe, and save to a favorites list via local storage.    
The user can easily increase or decrease servings as per his need and can view detailed directions.
